Today's Question:
Scientists are studying the diets of polar bears. Write a query to find the maximum amount of food (in kilograms) consumed by each polar bear in a single meal December 2024. Include the bear_name and biggest_meal_kg, and sort the results in descending order of largest meal consumed.

Table name: polar_bears

bear_id	bear_name	age
1	Snowball	10
2	Frosty	7
3	Iceberg	15
Table name: meal_log

log_id	bear_id	food_type	food_weight_kg	date
1	1	Seal	30	2024-12-01
2	2	Fish	15	2024-12-02
3	1	Fish	10	2024-12-03
4	3	Seal	25	2024-12-04
5	2	Seal	20	2024-12-05
6	3	Fish	18	2024-12-06
Question level of difficulty:
Medium


ANSWER:

SELECT 
    pb.bear_name,
    MAX(ml.food_weight_kg) AS biggest_meal_kg
FROM 
    polar_bears pb
JOIN 
    meal_log ml
ON 
    pb.bear_id = ml.bear_id
WHERE 
    strftime('%Y-%m', ml.date) = '2024-12'
GROUP BY 
    pb.bear_name
ORDER BY 
    biggest_meal_kg DESC;


QUERY RESULT:

bear_name	biggest_meal_kg
Snowball	30
Iceberg	25
Frosty	20
Correct!! ðŸŽ‰ Great work!
