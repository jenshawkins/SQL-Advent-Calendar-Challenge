ANSWER:

WITH CalorieDensity AS (
    SELECT
        e.event_id,
        e.event_name,
        m.dish_name,
        (m.calories / CAST(m.weight_g AS FLOAT)) AS calorie_density
    FROM
        events e
    JOIN
        menu m
    ON
        e.event_id = m.event_id
),
RankedDishes AS (
    SELECT
        event_id,
        event_name,
        dish_name,
        calorie_density,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY event_id ORDER BY calorie_density DESC) AS rank
    FROM
        CalorieDensity
)
SELECT
    event_name,
    dish_name,
    calorie_density
FROM
    RankedDishes
WHERE
    rank <= 3
ORDER BY
    event_name,
    rank;


QUERY RESULTS:

event_name		dish_name		calorie_density
Christmas Eve Dinner	Chocolate Yule Log	2.2
