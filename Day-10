ANSWER:

SELECT
    friend_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_resolutions,
    SUM(is_completed) AS completed_resolutions,
    ROUND(SUM(is_completed) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS success_percentage,
    CASE
        WHEN (SUM(is_completed) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) > 75 THEN 'Green'
        WHEN (SUM(is_completed) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) BETWEEN 50 AND 75 THEN 'Yellow'
        ELSE 'Red'
    END AS success_category
FROM
